# Analyzing the Brain Development scRNA-seq Data between Mouse and Human

## 1. Introduction
This is a personal project to aiming to identify the differences between the human and mouse brain development using data generated by scRNA-seq. The aim for this project is to:
- Implement scRNA-seq data from GEO to Seurat and Scanpy and process the data
- Use adult/embryo data of human/mouse, and compare
